# Design Pattern Categories

Design patterns are generally split into three main categories:

## 1. Creational Patterns

- **Purpose:** Deal with the creation (construction) of objects.
- **Approaches:**
  - **Explicit:** Using constructors.
  - **Implicit:** Using Dependency Injection (DI), reflection, etc.
- **Creation Styles:**
  - **Wholesale:** Single statement creation.
  - **Piecewise:** Step-by-step construction.

## 2. Structural Patterns

- **Purpose:** Concerned with the structure of classes and objects.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Many patterns act as wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface.
  - Emphasize the importance of good API design.

## 3. Behavioral Patterns

- **Purpose:** Focus on object interaction and responsibility.
- **Note:** These patterns are diverse and do not share a single central theme.
